vindac_conquest_fs,SHIP,"The VINDAC Conquest FS-class battlecruiser is the flagship of General Koyashi of the Void Nite Defense and Assault Corp, VINDAC for short. This ship is the embodiment of concentrated firepower, and has become even stronger with this variant made by ""Nite Corp"". In need of a flagship within the Persean sector, the Conquest was one of the best picks to become a flagship of this PMC together with their own ingenuity. Developed in the period just preceding the popularization of fighter craft, the class emphasizes firepower and speed over armor protection.

Space Naval tacticians of the day were confident that new weapons systems would always outperform armor and shields and thus were the key to winning an engagement. So why not build a ship for speed and power? Give it the armor protection of a cruiser, but arm it with the best weapons available to any ship, and have it remain faster than any of those lumbering behemoths of the line. The Conquest is a good example of these concepts put into a hull. Many other advanced technologies were incorporated into the design, including weapon mounts designed for a circling engagement. This maneuver requires greater navigational skill while serving to provide more tactical options to the commanding officers. 

Fortune favors the bold, the ancients said. This class of ships does indeed favor the bold captain, willing to risk everything for the thrill of victory.",,,,,,,
