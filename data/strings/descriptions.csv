vsEmpire,FACTION,Void Sakura Empire TEST,,,,,,,
vse_vindac,FACTION,"The Void Internal Night Defense/Assault Corp or V.I.N.D.A.C. is an elite mobile response and defense unit commanded by First General Rugg ""Bloodstone"" Koyashi. Its inception came about in response to a new mutation in Void Dragons allowing them to attack in the dead of night and sneak past DDZs (designated defense zones). Their armory is made up of fast, durable mechanized and airborne units meant to get in fast and hunker down to secure and repel a position, while their name suggests that they are limited to night time only activity they, it is more an indication for others to not fight them around that time of they, as they are deployed during any time of the day protecting Konta, along with the 32nd Mechanized- and 21st Infantry Guard Regiments, as well as other assets of the Void Sakura Empire throughout the sector as they take up most of the empire's main defensive battlegroups.

V.I.N.D.A.C. is split up into a hierarchy due too its size: The Corp > 2 Legions > 2x 2 Battalions. One of these legions is Rose Legion, in which the renowned 514th Recon Battalion codenamed Xenon find themselves. They act as the corp's main reconnaissance unit, and were deemed so profound at it, that General Bloodstone himself chose Xenon to be in charge of their recon fleets throughout the sector.

Of course the General himself also needed a unit, for he is not one to just sit behind a desk and command units from the safety and comfort of a command bunker. Because of this, the command unit codenamed Titan Squad was brought to life, which in turn again existed out of their own sub-units, though a bit different from any others as these were the elite specialist units: 
- The recon/overwatch specialist unit, Shadow Company, who are tasked with the more sensitive and [REDACTED] scouting missions as well as being in control of the early-warning system in case of incoming threats to the Void Sakura Empire's key assets in the sector. They will always be present when one of these assets comes under attack, indicating its importance.
- The mechanized pursuit unit, Shield Company. The name sounds kind of ironic, since shields are usually for defensive purposes. In this case however it is an indication of the advanced technology used on the mechanical units within the company that not only makes them fast enough to intercept anyone trying to escape the corp, but also plated with special armor that is light in weight as to not rip into Shield Company's pursuit speed.",,,,,,,

#CUSTOM PLANETS & STATIONS,,,,,,,,,
celaka_hideaway,CUSTOM,"At first seeming like an empty husk, near complete destruction, not being called a home for anyone but station dwelling rats and other animals left behind that somehow still managed to survive, this station turns out to be quite a good hideaway for anyone with a bounty on their head, that wants to take some time away from the rest of civilization, or to simply store their most precious belongings safely and secure.

#CUSTOM SHIPS,,,,,,,,,
vindac_conquest_fs,SHIP,"The VINDAC Conquest FS-class battlecruiser is the flagship of General Koyashi of the Void Nite Defense and Assault Corp, VINDAC for short. This ship is the embodiment of concentrated firepower, and has become even stronger with this variant made by ""Nite Corp"". In need of a flagship within the Persean sector, the Conquest was one of the best picks to become a flagship of this PMC together with their own ingenuity. Developed in the period just preceding the popularization of fighter craft, the class emphasizes firepower and speed over armor protection.

Space Naval tacticians of the day were confident that new weapons tnb.vndac.world.systems would always outperform armor and shields and thus were the key to winning an engagement. So why not build a ship for speed and power? Give it the armor protection of a cruiser, but arm it with the best weapons available to any ship, and have it remain faster than any of those lumbering behemoths of the line. The Conquest is a good example of these concepts put into a hull. Many other advanced technologies were incorporated into the design, including weapon mounts designed for a circling engagement. This maneuver requires greater navigational skill while serving to provide more tactical options to the commanding officers.

Fortune favors the bold, the ancients said. This class of ships does indeed favor the bold captain, willing to risk everything for the thrill of victory.",,,,,,,
vindac_atlas,SHIP,"The Atlas-class ships are large space-borne cargo platforms with an FTL drive and a few defensive systems. Hundreds of containers can be latched on to the hull and carried with ease by this behemoth. This altered version of the Atlas, done by a PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood, also holds space for 2 fighter wing squadron hidden between the containers so it always has some form of external protection other than its armaments.

Typically used to efficiently resupply entire outposts, the Atlas is ill suited to the small and fast trade runs that are the mainstay of commerce in the sector. Their slow speed and large size always tempt uninvited guests, ranging from curious gawkers come to see the hulking colossus, to scavenging pirates aiming to disable a container's magneto-gravitic fastener, to Pather fanatics bent on destroying it all. Nonetheless, the Hegemony makes wide use of them, especially to offload biomass from farming worlds on a seasonal basis. For this purpose, the Hegemony assembles large Atlas convoys; these are protected by military cruisers that ensure that the lifeline of Hegemony citizens is kept safe.

The captaincy of an Atlas is a rare punishment for the able, an uneven mixture of soul-numbing boredom and abject terror, being the results of normal trade runs and pirate attacks, respectively.",,,,,,,
vindac_brawler,SHIP,"Typically deployed to beef up system police forces and port authority security, the Brawler-class frigate is a robust design which trades mobility (and comfort) for impressive firepower, armor, and a destroyer-grade power generator. Because of this it is also a perfect filler for fleets of the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"".",,,,,,,
vindac_broadsword,SHIP,"Tough and agile, the Broadsword carries a decoy flare launcher that draws defensive fire away from high-value targets like bombers and their payloads. However, it can falter if faced with the need to deal the killing blow itself. Altered by the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"", this variant of the Broadsword also holds 2 swarmer pods as well as a very small frontal shield generator.",,,,,,,
vindac_buffalo,SHIP,"The go-to choice for medium cargo hauling in the Sector, the Buffalo-class freighter exemplifies the ""Load-n-Pray"" principle prevalent in Sector shipping. Being the most easily obtainable cargo freighter, it was an easy choice for the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"" to grab the blueprints for it and make it their own.

Sporting just a single small weapon emplacement, the hull of the ship is no more than a large engine with a tiny crew quarters section and cargo grapplers. A captain taking this ship out without a convoy rarely gets to make the same mistake twice. Incapable of anything resembling a combat maneuver, the lateral thrusters on Buffalo-class ships are designed to merely enable it to dock when (and if) it reaches its destination.

The ship engines are the greatest contributor to hull cost, which, while low, is still within the norms for a medium freighter. The greatest contributing factor to its ubiquity is the fact that the blueprint for this ship is usually hardcoded into every orbital shipyard's blueprint database.",,,,,,,
vindac_colossus,SHIP,"The Colossus is a sturdy and venerable hull well-suited to conditions in the post-Collapse Sector, albeit possessing primitive accommodations and limited defensive armament. However, with this variant being able to hold a large ballistic weapon on top, as well as having an improved shield generator, the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"" has definitely improved on the design while keeping its cargo space intact.

Before it was outmatched by the brutal economic efficiency of the Atlas superfreighter, the Colossus heavy freighter formed the core of Domain frontier supply fleets. Thicker than strictly necessary hull plating provides protection against cosmic hazards both natural and human.",,,,,,,
vindac_condor,SHIP,"This Condor-class variant has been upgraded and improved by the skillful members of the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"". Seeing heavy service in the Sector already for what this carrier-converted freighter is well known for, it was a great pick for The Brotherhood to get fighters into the fray with little resources spent, both in deployment costs for a carrier as well as procurement of fighters.

Even with limited flight deck space, the Condor gets the job done, relying on its tough armor, excellent bulkhead strength, and a respectable (for a light carrier) weapons package.

This light carrier design is derived from Tarsus-class freighters modified by desperate scavengers and pirates. The conversion process was once an involved and complex affair requiring space dock facilities, but nowadays any hull-capable forge that will accept a stock Tarsus spec will, with the addition of a custom modchip, get you something just as good.

Some in the Sector argue that even the Domain, with all their technological know-how, relied on similar conversions to make more efficient use of a merchant fleet during times of escalated hostilities on the voluminous galactic frontier. Others point out that it is unclear how ubiquitous this approach was - there could have been fleets of Condors roaming Domain space, but there is scarce hard evidence one way or the other. Such data was all lost in the Collapse.",,,,,,,
vindac_conquest,SHIP,"The Conquest-class battlecruiser is the embodiment of concentrated firepower, and has become even stronger with this variant made by ""The Nite Brotherhood"". In need of a battlecruiser, the Conquest was one of the best picks to become one of the main flagships of this PMC together with their own ingenuity. Developed in the period just preceding the popularization of fighter craft, the class emphasizes firepower and speed over armor protection.

vindac_dram,SHIP,"A light tanker with enough fuel capacity to more than double the effective range of a small task force or convoy. Giving it a new lick of paint, the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"" gave this variant an entirely new look.",,,,,,,
vindac_drone_borer,SHIP,"Slow and not very sturdy, this combat-modified mining drone is nonetheless capable of keeping hostiles off its mothership for a time. Fielded in numbers, it can even present a credible threat to smaller combat ships.

""This was not worth the paint, but we have to stick to our colors to let everyone know that we, are present.""
~ General Rug'ger, The Nite Brotherhood",,,,,,,
vindac_eagle,SHIP,"Eagle-class cruisers are often found at the core of military fleets headed for battle. It is not hard to see why: A strong overall profile, with a robust engine, the Eagle's deadly weapons package is a threat to all enemies. This variant being manufactured, updated and used by the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"", with increased statistics and even some newly built-in hull modifications, makes it an even better foe in battle to fight against, and leaves whoever has to face it to think twice before deciding whether or not to go against this newly updated, freshly manufactured version.

The Eagle can deliver a strong tactical punch to enemy formations. Its numerous turret and hardpoint emplacements make it very dangerous to smaller foes. Decent armor and a strong shield emitter let it hold space while outnumbered, or even when faced with the rare larger ship. 

These strengths are somewhat countered by strike craft - an Eagle captain must always watch their scopes for an approaching strike squadron, since their ship will be easily crippled by multiple hits from modern strike weapons. 

The embodiment of the sleek and powerful space cruiser from the time of the Domain, the Eagle-class ships are a beautiful reminder of the technological and aesthetic achievements of humanity's past. ","Agile for a cruiser, the Eagle is difficult to flank and has impressive and focused frontal firepower.",,,,,,
vindac_falcon,SHIP,"Often called the Eagle cruiser's little brother, the Falcon-class cruiser sacrifices armor for speed, neatly filling the light cruiser role in military fleets throughout the Sector. Having received no other upgrades other than the modifications done on all ships of the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"", it has stayed a little behind the Eagle when it comes to it's statistics.

The ""light"" designation does not indicate a significant reduction in firepower, however, making the Falcon a valuable tactical asset to any fleet. The ship is easily able to fill a wide variety of roles, from close support to assault, given the proper configuration. 

The Falcon's top notch engines give it the ability to quickly disengage from battle should its defenses be pressed to a critical point.

Swift and elegant, Falcon-class cruisers are often found as lead elements in larger fleet formations, or deployed to reinforce anti-pirate convoys.","This light cruiser features mobility that puts smaller ships to shame, but its firepower is somewhat lacking. However, the Falcon can still face down smaller ships due to its cruiser-grade power generators and armor plating.",,,,,,
vindac_gremlin,SHIP,"This ancient phase prototype rig was never intended for mass production, yet someone managed to extract its reverse-engineered blueprints from the firmware of a nanoforge. The resulting skeleton of hull is given standard armour cladding, the merest nod of a life-support module, and as many missiles as can be crammed into the remaining voids. Only having received a new paintjob and general modifications, it merely serves as a simple phase ship for the PMC called ""THe Nite Brotherhood"".

The Gremlin, as it became known, is hated by its crew who suffer not only the dubious honour of a close-in strike role but also the disturbing wash of the prototype phase coil. Substance abuse is ubiquitous. An awful little ship.",,,,,,,
vindac_hammerhead,SHIP,"A midline destroyer from the golden age of the Domain, the Hammerhead is respected for its staying power in battle as well as its ballistic capabilities. Also being one of the better obtainable ships, the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"" took the blueprints of this amazing ship and gave it a new paintjob.",,,,,,,
vindac_heron,SHIP,"The Heron provides the strategic and tactical mobility of a cruiser with potential firepower limited only by available strike-craft. It is the perfect accompaniment to the quick-moving and hard-hitting fleets of the ""Nite Brotherhood"", a PMC who have revealed themselves after a long time, having been in the sector since before the collapse.

Historically the Heron represented a movement in Domain Armada strategy from a heavy capital ship doctrine based on overwhelming firepower toward a focus on strike craft and support cruisers that enable sufficient firepower to be quickly focused on weak points, a strategic shift that would reverse itself as a natural reaction against tradition from each successive generation of Armada officers. This process was occurring once more in the cycles immediately preceding the fall of the gate system and, in something of a coup for the so-called “Cruiser School”, the forward-thinking Altair Exotech won the Heron design contract over the traditional manufacturer of heavy Armada warships, Orion Shipyards. 

However the doctrinal shift embodied by the Heron was interrupted by the isolation of The Fall, and as such it is not often found in core Hegemony fleets (whose officers still cling to tradition). This hull has however found great popularity among the independent worlds, megacorporations, and mercenary forces of the Sector that tend to field leaner, faster fleets.",,,,,,,
vindac_hound,SHIP,"An old but durable hull class, this frigate is sometimes used to ferry cargo instead of for combat duty within the sector. Altered to have a decent shield generator, it might however show a bit more worthy in battles, even if it's only to stall whoever tries to defy ""The Nite Brotherhood"", a PMC newly revealed in the sector.",,,,,,,
vindac_kite,SHIP,"This ""Kite""-class aeroshuttle would usually be a familiar civilian design, the day-to-day reminder of Fabrique Orbitale's reputation for aeronautical engineering- a valuable specialty even in the age of space travel. However, this version has been manufactured and improved by the engineers and researchers of the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"", giving it their well-known black & red paintjob as well as improved statistics, giving it a headstart compared to other ""Kite""-class aeroshuttles.

A familiar civilian design, the ""Kite""-class aeroshuttle is the day-to-day reminder of Fabrique Orbitale's reputation for aeronautical engineering- a valuable specialty even in the age of space travel. This compact space/aircraft is streamlined for efficient atmospheric flight and boasts a grid of cleverly distributed short-burst maneuvering thrusters coordinated by a delta-level AI subsystem to ensure smooth landings (a point driven home by Fabrique marketing by way of amusing ad-holos featuring a well-dressed couple and an overfull wine glass). The Kite has powerful engines for a civilian ship of its size, though zero-G maneuverability leaves something to be desired when the special subsystem is not engaged.

In the dangerous cycles post-Collapse, the Kite has been outfitted with a defense turret in place of the executive-class viewing dome and the two auxiliary jet-pods are replaced with missile systems (which do not need to draw on the limited powerplant). It won't stand up in a fair fight, but the Kite can be given unexpectedly sharp teeth and use its speed to escape from raiders. Luddic Path radicals have even been known to use modified Kite to deliver strike weapons against helpless freighters, followed by engaging the maneuvering subsystem to make a swift exit to avoid the wrath of their victim's escort.",,,,,,,
vindac_mining_drone,SHIP,"Sturdy and uncrewed, the Mining Pod can provide a bit of a distraction and a bit of fire support, and not much else. Incapable of operating away from the mothership.

""We only gave it a new paintjob, not gonna waste any other resources on that""
~ General Rug'ger, The Nite Brotherhood",,,,,,,
vindac_mule,SHIP,"The Mule is a rugged and reliable combat-capable freighter which built its reputation on the sparsely-patrolled frontiers of the Domain. Post-collapse, the Mule's appeal only grown through the cycles of chaos which wrack the Persean Sector and elevate the importance of strong armor and powerful weapons to otherwise thrifty traders, scavengers, and prospectors. It didn't scare off the ""Nite Brotherhood"" from using it however, giving it a new paintjob and calling it a day, it is a common sight within smaller fleets of this PMC.

The original design officially designated its medium turret mount as a 'gimbaled mining utility attachment point', and even Domain operators from time past knew to read between the lines: without an escort, the Mule-class packs enough of a kick to make pirates think twice before attacking. Of course this also means that the Mule has become the ideal vehicle for a down-on-its-luck or merely opportunistic civilian crew to themselves turn pirate.",,,,,,,
vindac_phaeton,SHIP,"A medium tanker with enough fuel capacity to support a larger fleet. Tanker duty is often considered punitive in the Hegem-…*STATIC*…*INTERRUPTION*...*STATIC*... Being smarter than the faction that will not be named, the ""Nite Brotherhood"" uses these tankers to keep their ships ready for battle at all times. Because what chance do you have if you run out of fuel in the midst of battle? And with an extra turret it's also a bit better than your regular Phaeton.",,,,,,,
vindac_prometheus,SHIP,"A tanker of vast capacity used to shift strategic quantities of fuel between worlds. Unlike its smaller cousins, the Prometheus features a reasonable defensive arsenal to protect its valuable and volatile cargo. This variant having an added 2 small and 1 medium ballistic hardpoints, as well as an increase in shielding, makes it easier for the crew to keep the ship safe in case it is ambushed.",,,,,,,
vindac_shepherd,SHIP,"The Ko Combine r450 ""Shepherd"" sets the standard for civilian drone tenders with unmatched reliability, low cost, and internal volume given to crew comfort. Having had minor alterations by the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"" as well as a new paintjob, it's a little bit better at handling a fight, though it will most likely still be outmatched when being outnumbered even if it's only by a single extra foe.

The ""Borer"" is built on a hardy, maneuverable semi-autonomous drone chassis with shielding suitable for hazardous operations in which high radiation or physical impacts may be expected. Commonly used in mining applications, they have also found use in salvage, ordnance disposal, and even fission meltdown clean-up. The HK mod package gives specifications for altering the primary cutting beam's focus and patches the rudimentary AI with crude tactical algorithms pirated from obsolete Domain Colonial Garrison drone software. Appendices of the mod package recommend caution when employing HK-modified drones in non-combat situations.",,,,,,,
vindac_talon,SHIP,"Fast and cheap, the Talon sports surprising firepower and is capable of dispatching enemy fighters. It can also deal appreciable damage to larger ships when used en masse, though such use usually results in heavy pilot losses. Trying to lower the pilot loss in battle, an extra Talon has been added to every wing of the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"".",,,,,,,
vindac_venture,SHIP,"Tough, dependable and not overly expensive, Venture-class cruisers are usually constructed by private corporations for escort duty or by small non-aligned worlds for system defense. Putting the emphasis on ""usually"", as this is a newer and upgraded variant. Made to become a well-rounded ship by the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"" to improve on, this variant is a strong frontline bulkhead when brought in numbers, though even only a couple of these newly designed and statistically updated versions are more than enough to fight battles that elsewise would have been a lost cause. Being a private military company, The Nite Brotherhood made sure that this Venture would become a force to be reckoned with in battle, even more than the common Venture already did.

The Venture-class ships are perhaps the most widely used civilian cruisers in the Sector. The blueprints for the Venture are widely available and can often be secured without too much trouble. 

When used by small corporations, the ship is usually the pride of the fleet and is used to underpin vital operations. Due to its ubiquity, the vessel also serves with quite a few pirate outfits, where it sometimes fills the role of command ship.

",,,,,,,
vindac_vigilance,SHIP,"An excellent harasser and support frigate, the Vigilance-class has oversized (for its class) energy and missile mounts. While it shines in a fleet setting, it can be easily overwhelmed by large numbers of smaller threats. This however won't be a problem for the ""Nite Brotherhood"" since they never let an officer fight on their own.",,,,,,,
vindac_wolf,SHIP,"A technologically advanced frigate with an efficient shield generator and an impressive weapons package that allows it to punch far above its weight. These same characteristics mean its frigate-grade power core struggles to keep up, making careful flux management a priority. The engineering package added by the ""Nite Brotherhood"" should help out a bit with this issue however.",,,,,,,
vindac_valkyrie,SHIP,"The Valkyrie is a standard destroyer-sized troop transport with enough room to carry two companies of marines. Tactically it is weak for its size, only able to defend itself at short ranges from missiles and fighters. Having obtained the blueprints to the ship, the PMC called ""The Nite Brotherhood"", this variant comes with a new paintjob and an extra turret to protect the engines from EMP missiles, as well as a medium sized Flak Cannon at the front that also has a decent reach to the sides to protect against missiles and fighters when it's trying to escape hostiles.

As an atmosphere-capable combat dropship with ground support weapon mounts designed to operate during re-entry and when grounded, the Valkyrie is often used to deploy heavy infantry support for tech raids on decivilized worlds. 

The ability to deliver large amounts of troops directly to ground targets while providing fire support prompted Hegemony bureaucrats to designate the hull as ""restricted"" for sale to third parties. Naturally, news of the restriction made it to the general public cycles before it came into effect, launching ill-fated speculation in the future prices of this class. Thus, overproduction and the hull's limited options made the speculator's activities bets largely moot, the only net result is that now, due to oversupply, it is just as easy to obtain a Valkyrie ship as before news of the Hegemony ban ever became public.",,,,,,,
