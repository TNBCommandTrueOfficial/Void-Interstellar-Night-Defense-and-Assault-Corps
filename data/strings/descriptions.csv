vse_vindac,FACTION,"The Void Internal Night Defense/Assault Corp or V.I.N.D.A.C. is an elite mobile response and defense unit commanded by First General Rugg ""Bloodstone"" Koyashi. Its inception came about in response to a new mutation in Void Dragons allowing them to attack in the dead of night and sneak past DDZs (designated defense zones). Their armory is made up of fast, durable mechanized and airborne units meant to get in fast and hunker down to secure and repel a position, while their name suggests that they are limited to night time only activity they, it is more an indication for others to not fight them around that time of they, as they are deployed during any time of the day protecting Konta, along with the 32nd Mechanized- and 21st Infantry Guard Regiments, as well as other assets of the Void Sakura Empire throughout the sector as they take up most of the empire's main defensive battlegroups.

V.I.N.D.A.C. is split up into a hierarchy due too its size: The Corp > 2 Legions > 2x 2 Battalions. One of these legions is Rose Legion, in which the renowned 514th Recon Battalion codenamed Xenon find themselves. They act as the corp's main reconnaissance unit, and were deemed so profound at it, that General Bloodstone himself chose Xenon to be in charge of their recon fleets throughout the sector.

Of course the General himself also needed a unit, for he is not one to just sit behind a desk and command units from the safety and comfort of a command bunker. Because of this, the command unit codenamed Titan Squad was brought to life, which in turn again existed out of their own sub-units, though a bit different from any others as these were the elite specialist units: 
- The recon/overwatch specialist unit, Shadow Company, who are tasked with the more sensitive and [REDACTED] scouting missions as well as being in control of the early-warning system in case of incoming threats to the Void Sakura Empire's key assets in the sector. They will always be present when one of these assets comes under attack, indicating its importance.
- The mechanized pursuit unit, Shield Company. The name sounds kind of ironic, since shields are usually for defensive purposes. In this case however it is an indication of the advanced technology used on the mechanical units within the company that not only makes them fast enough to intercept anyone trying to escape the corp, but also plated with special armor that is light in weight as to not rip into Shield Company's pursuit speed.",,,,,,,

#CUSTOM PLANETS & STATIONS,,,,,,,,,
celaka_hideaway,CUSTOM,"At first seeming like an empty husk, near complete destruction, not being called a home for anyone but station dwelling rats and other animals left behind that somehow still managed to survive, this station turns out to be quite a good hideaway for anyone with a bounty on their head, that wants to take some time away from the rest of civilization, or to simply store their most precious belongings safely and secure. This hideaway is floating all the way out here between the nebula in the far reaches of the Celaka system for a reason.",,,,,,,
celaka_konta,CUSTOM,"Home to the Void Sakura Empire, the former regular city of Konta which started out as a village between tribes, has over the years successfully expanded across the entire planet after the countless wars between the Void Sakura Empire and the Exile Republic once the Republic left the planet and showed to not return in months as their last planetary headquarters fell under the combined forces' last push of the VSE lead by VINDAC.","Test a, to the test b",Flying towards,,,,,
celaka_vnc_vanguard,CUSTOM,"The VNC Vanguard is the citadel battlestation of the Void Sakura Empire. Built after the planetary war with the Exile Republic came to a close, it's now the first line of defense of Konta in case of raids, invasions, and other forms of attack. If in any case somehow control is being taken over Konta without taking out the Vanguard, it may just prove that unauthorized control over the planet will be short lasting.",,,,,,,
celaka_exileania,CUSTOM,"After being chased off the planet of Konta after many years of conflict with the Void Sakura Empire, the Exiles Republic retreated to their true stronghold; a planet given the name Exileania by the Republic on the other side of the system. From here, it was going to be either a final stand, or rising above their past mistakes.",,,,,,,

#CUSTOM SHIPS,,,,,,,,,
vindac_conquest_fs,SHIP,"The VINDAC Conquest FS-class battlecruiser is the flagship of General Koyashi of the Void Nite Defense and Assault Corp, VINDAC for short. This ship is the embodiment of concentrated firepower, and has become even stronger with this variant made by ""Nite Corp"". In need of a flagship within the Persean sector, the Conquest was one of the best picks to become a flagship of this PMC together with their own ingenuity. Developed in the period just preceding the popularization of fighter craft, the class emphasizes firepower and speed over armor protection.

Space Naval tacticians of the day were confident that new weapons tnb.vndac.world.systems would always outperform armor and shields and thus were the key to winning an engagement. So why not build a ship for speed and power? Give it the armor protection of a cruiser, but arm it with the best weapons available to any ship, and have it remain faster than any of those lumbering behemoths of the line. The Conquest is a good example of these concepts put into a hull. Many other advanced technologies were incorporated into the design, including weapon mounts designed for a circling engagement. This maneuver requires greater navigational skill while serving to provide more tactical options to the commanding officers.

Fortune favors the bold, the ancients said. This class of ships does indeed favor the bold captain, willing to risk everything for the thrill of victory.",,,,,,,
